[![CRAN
status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/lsr)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lsr)

The goal of lsr is to provide tools intended to make introductory
statistics easier to teach, including wrappers for common hypothesis
tests and basic data manipulation. The package is associated with
<https://learningstatistincswithr.com>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of lsr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lsr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/lsr")
```

## Note

I am in the process of updating the package. Assuming that I am able to
list myself as maintainer using my real name, version 0.5.1 will be a
minimal update to fix CRAN notes, warnings and errors. Other changes
such as tidying the code base and fixing bugs are planned for release
0.6. The long-term plan for the package is maintenance: it is unlikely
to see new functionality or API changes, but I intend to add unit tests,
improve the internals, and generally make the package more reliable.
Breaking changes will be avoided except as needed to fix erroneous
results.
