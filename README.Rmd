The goal of lsr is to provide tools intended to make introductory statistics easier to teach, including wrappers for common hypothesis tests and basic data manipulation. The package is associated with the introductory textbook at https://learningstatisticswithr.com

## Installation

You can install the released version of lsr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lsr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/lsr")
```

## Note

I am in the process of updating the package after a long hiatus. The long-term plan for the package is maintenance-focused: it is unlikely to see new functionality or API changes, but I intend to extend unit tests, improve the internals, and generally make the package more reliable. Breaking changes will be avoided except as needed to fix erroneous results.
