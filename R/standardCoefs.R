# standardCoefs() computes the standardised regression coefficients (i.e. beta
# weights) for a regression model. It takes an lm object as input, and outputs a
# matrix showing both the raw "b" weights and the standardised "beta" weights.
# Note that, if you're serious about computing the relative importance of the
# predictors, you'd be better off looking at the relaimpo package, which provides
# better tools for relative importance regression. The standardCoefs() function
# is just a handy crutch for beginners: beta weights aren't the best solution to
# the problem.
standardCoefs <- function( x ) {

  if( !methods::is(x,"lm") ) {stop( '"x" must be a linear model object')}

  # read off the useful info
  term.names <- names(x$coefficients)[-1] # all names except "intercept"
  b <- x$coefficients[-1] # grab coefficients except "intercept"

  # construct the design matrix
  predictors <- stats::model.matrix(x$terms, data = x$model)
  predictors <- predictors[ ,-1, drop=FALSE] # (we don't want the intercept)
  predictors <- as.data.frame(predictors)  # hack!!

  # standard deviations
  sy <- stats::sd(x$model[[1]])       # sd for the outcome
  sx <- sapply(predictors, stats::sd)  # sd for the predictors

  # now compute beta
  beta <- b * sx / sy

  # convert to matrix
