# rmAll() removes all variables from the workspace. It's not noticeably
# different to rm( list=objects() ), and it's largely unnecessary in
# RStudio because there's a button you can click to do the same thing,
# but it can be handy for beginners who don't yet understand how arguments
# work.

      print("Workspace is already empty")
      return( invisible(1) )
    }

    # first, display all the objects...
