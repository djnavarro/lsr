## Author note regarding the maintainer change

Although the email address and names have changed, they correspond
to the same person. Unfortunately the old maintainer email address
no longer exists (I moved from Adelaide to UNSW some time ago), but 
it should (I hope) be possible to verify that I am the same person by 
checking the website associated with the package 
(https://learningstatisticswithr.com), my professional
website (https://djnavarro.net), or the GitHub repository for the
package (https://github.com/djnavarro/lsr). My apologies for the 
awkward situation: quite a lot has changed since I was last in a 
position to update this package.

If there is any other documentation or confirmation I can provide
please don't hesitate to ask.

Kind regards,
Danielle
